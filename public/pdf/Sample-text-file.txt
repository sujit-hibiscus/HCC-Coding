# Comprehensive ICD-10-CM Coding Analysis

## PASS 1: Condition Identification and Classification

### Primary Conditions (from Assessment/Plan)
1. Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 5 chronic kidney disease
2. Heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)
3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with multiple complications:
   - Diabetic nephropathy
   - Diabetic retinopathy, non-proliferative
   - Diabetic peripheral neuropathy
   - Diabetic peripheral angiopathy with foot ulcer
4. Chronic Kidney Disease, Stage 5 (eGFR 9 mL/min)
5. Anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease
6. Hyperlipidemia

### Additional Conditions (from HPI/PMH/Labs)
7. Obesity (BMI 32.2)
8. Osteoarthritis
9. Hyperkalemia (K: 5.3 mEq/L)
10. Small healing foot ulcer on right plantar surface

## PASS 2: Relationship Analysis and Documentation Evaluation

### Condition Relationships
- Hypertension documented as affecting both heart and kidneys, with heart failure
- Diabetes documented as causing nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and angiopathy with foot ulcer
- Anemia explicitly linked to chronic kidney disease
- Metabolic acidosis indicated by low CO2 (19 mEq/L), likely due to kidney disease

### Supporting Documentation
- Hypertension: BP readings 172/94 mmHg and 168/92 mmHg
- Heart Failure: S3 gallop, 2+ pitting edema, JVD elevated, bibasilar crackles, BNP 725 pg/mL, pulmonary edema on CXR
- CKD Stage 5: eGFR 9 mL/min, BUN 82 mg/dL, Creatinine 4.8 mg/dL, renal ultrasound showing atrophy
- Diabetes: HbA1c 8.9%, glucose 182 mg/dL, insulin therapy
- Diabetic complications:
  - Nephropathy: Proteinuria (3+), UACR 1,850 mg/g
  - Retinopathy: Funduscopic findings, ophthalmology report
  - Neuropathy: Decreased sensation in stocking distribution
  - Angiopathy: Trophic changes, decreased hair on lower extremities
- Anemia: Hgb 10.2 g/dL, Hct 32%
- Obesity: BMI 32.2 kg/m²
